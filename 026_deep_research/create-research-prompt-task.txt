# Create Research Prompt Task

## Purpose

To generate a comprehensive, structured research prompt optimized for AI research agents on any topic, ensuring thorough, targeted, and actionable research outcomes.

## Process Overview

This task guides the user through a systematic process to create an optimized research prompt, following these key stages:
1. Context gathering
2. Objective definition
3. Research structure development
4. Prompt drafting
5. Review and refinement

## Detailed Process

### 1. Context Gathering

Begin by asking the user about:
- The general topic area
- Their current knowledge level
- The purpose of the research (decision-making, exploration, validation)
- Any specific hypotheses or assumptions they want to test
- Time constraints or depth requirements

### 2. Objective Definition

Collaboratively define:
- Primary research objective (1-2 sentences)
- Key decisions this research will inform
- Success criteria for the research
- Scope boundaries (what's in/out of scope)

### 3. Research Structure Development

Guide the user to develop:
- 3-5 key research areas/themes
- 2-4 specific questions for each area
- Preferred information sources (academic, industry reports, case studies, etc.)
- Desired output format (comparative tables, narrative analysis, etc.)
- Evaluation criteria if comparing options

### 4. Prompt Drafting

Synthesize the information into a structured prompt with these sections:
- **CONTEXT:** Background information and current knowledge
- **OBJECTIVE:** Clear statement of research goals
- **KEY AREAS:** Main themes to investigate
- **SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:** Detailed questions for each area
- **SOURCES:** Preferred information sources
- **OUTPUT FORMAT:** How results should be structured
- **EVALUATION CRITERIA:** Metrics for comparison (if applicable)

### 5. Review and Refinement

- Present the draft prompt for review
- Explain the structure and rationale
- Solicit feedback on:
  - Clarity of instructions
  - Comprehensiveness of questions
  - Appropriateness of scope
  - Any missing elements
- Refine based on feedback
- Finalize and format for easy use

## Output

A comprehensive research prompt that:
- Clearly communicates research objectives
- Provides structured guidance for investigation
- Specifies desired output format
- Is immediately usable with AI research tools
