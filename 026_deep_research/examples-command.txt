# Research Prompt: Evaluating Serverless vs. Container Technologies for Enterprise Applications

## CONTEXT
Our organization is considering modernizing our application infrastructure. Currently, we use traditional VM-based deployments but want to explore more scalable, cost-effective options. We have limited experience with both serverless and container technologies. Our applications are primarily microservices-based with varying workload patterns.

## OBJECTIVE
Evaluate serverless and container technologies to determine which approach (or hybrid) would best suit our enterprise applications based on performance, cost, operational complexity, and long-term scalability.

## KEY AREAS
1. Technical Comparison
   - Question 1.1: What are the fundamental architectural differences between serverless and container technologies?
   - Question 1.2: How do these technologies compare in terms of performance, particularly for applications with varying workload patterns?
   - Question 1.3: What are the security implications of each approach?

2. Operational Considerations
   - Question 2.1: How do development workflows differ between serverless and container-based approaches?
   - Question 2.2: What monitoring, logging, and debugging capabilities exist for each technology?
   - Question 2.3: How does each approach impact DevOps practices and team structure?

3. Cost Analysis
   - Question 3.1: What is the typical cost structure for serverless vs. container deployments?
   - Question 3.2: How do costs scale with different usage patterns (steady vs. spiky workloads)?
   - Question 3.3: What hidden costs exist that organizations often overlook?

4. Migration Pathways
   - Question 4.1: What are proven strategies for migrating from VMs to either serverless or containers?
   - Question 4.2: What tools exist to facilitate migration to each technology?
   - Question 4.3: What are common pitfalls during migration and how can they be avoided?

## SOURCES
- Technical documentation from major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Industry case studies from enterprises of similar size and complexity
- Academic research on performance benchmarks
- Expert opinions from industry thought leaders
- Post-implementation reviews

## OUTPUT FORMAT
- Comparative analysis table of key features and capabilities
- Pros/cons list for each technology
- Decision framework with weighted criteria
- Visual decision tree for different application types
- Recommended migration roadmap

## EVALUATION CRITERIA
- Performance under varying loads (weight: 25%)
- Total cost of ownership (weight: 25%)
- Operational complexity and learning curve (weight: 20%)
- Vendor lock-in risk (weight: 15%)
- Ecosystem maturity and support (weight: 15%)
