## Question Formulation Tips

1. **Use open-ended phrasing** that requires analysis rather than yes/no answers
2. **Include specific parameters** (timeframes, contexts, populations)
3. **Focus on one concept per question** rather than combining multiple ideas
4. **Use precise terminology** appropriate to the domain
5. **Ensure questions are answerable** given available information sources
